PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

Product Name: NutriScan AI
Tagline: “From Bloodwork to Basket — Automatically.”

Executive Summary

NutriScan AI is an AI-powered health assistant that transforms uploaded bloodwork reports into actionable nutrition decisions. Users upload a lab report (PDF), the system detects deficiencies (e.g., Vitamin D), explains them in plain English, and automatically generates a grocery cart via the Instacart API with foods and supplements tailored to correct those deficiencies.

The product bridges the gap between clinical information and real-world behavior change.

Problem Statement

Patients frequently receive lab reports but:

Do not understand medical terminology

Ignore mild deficiencies

Lack clear next steps

Delay corrective action

Have no easy way to translate lab results into dietary changes

Example:
A user sees “Vitamin D: 14 ng/mL” but does not know:

Is that serious?

What symptoms can it cause?

What foods help?

Should I take supplements?

There is no seamless system that converts lab results into immediate nutritional action.

Core Features

6.1 PDF Upload & Processing

Description:
Users upload lab reports in PDF format (scanned or digital).

Requirements:

Secure upload

Support multiple lab formats

Extract test name, result value, units, and reference range

Convert to structured JSON format

Output:
Validated biomarker data ready for analysis.

6.2 Deficiency Detection Engine

Description:
Analyzes biomarker values against clinically accepted threshold ranges.

Example Logic:

Vitamin D < 20 ng/mL → Severe Deficiency

20–30 ng/mL → Insufficient

30 ng/mL → Normal

Output:

Severity classification

Health implications

Suggested daily intake guidance

6.3 AI Explanation Layer

Description:
Generates a clear, user-friendly explanation of lab results.

Example Output:
“Your Vitamin D level is below the recommended range. Low levels may contribute to fatigue, weakened immunity, and reduced bone density. Increasing intake through diet and supplementation may help improve levels.”

Tone Requirements:

Clear

Actionable

Non-alarmist

Non-diagnostic

Encourages consultation with a healthcare provider

6.4 Nutrition Recommendation Engine

Description:
Maps identified deficiencies to evidence-based food and supplement recommendations.

Example (Vitamin D):

Food Recommendations:

Salmon

Sardines

Fortified milk

Egg yolks

UV-exposed mushrooms

Supplement Recommendation:

Vitamin D3 (dosage range based on severity category)

Requirements:

Evidence-based nutrient mapping

Support dietary preferences (vegan, lactose-free, etc.)

Avoid medical dosing claims
